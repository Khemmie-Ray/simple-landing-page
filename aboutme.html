    <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
    <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat,</strong>I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much</p>
    <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
    <h4>How I turned things around</h4>
    <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and quit my job.</p>
    <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. and it worked.</p>
    <h4>Now I live the simple life</h4> 
    <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
    <p>With how much it turned my life around,<strong> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
